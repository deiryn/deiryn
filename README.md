### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

<!--
**deiryn/deiryn** is a âœ¨ _special_ âœ¨ repository because its `README.md` (this file) appears on your GitHub profile. --!>

<!--
Here are some ideas to get you started: --!>

- ðŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently working on translations, bots and my private projects<br/>

- ðŸ’¬ Ask me about Python programming!<br/>

- ðŸ“« How to reach me: deiryn@protonmail.com (I read it from time to time)<br/>

- âš¡ Fun fact: I tend to think my project through a few times before actually starting to make them, sometimes that leads to me dropping the project
